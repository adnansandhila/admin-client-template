Refresh Token Flow
To obtain an access token through the refresh token flow, you need to provide the OAuth client credentials as well as the refresh token.

POST https://{host}/oauth/token
Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token={token}
Refresh tokens expire 6 months after last usage. Therefore a refresh token that is regularly used will never expire.
